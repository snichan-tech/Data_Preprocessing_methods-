# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Notes 🧹

This repository is a collection of my **Jupyter Notebooks** where I’ve documented step-by-step methods for handling common data preprocessing problems.  
The goal is to make it easier for anyone (like me, still learning) who struggles to find clean notes and examples in one place.

## 📌 What’s Inside
- **Handling Missing Data**
  - Dropping missing values
  - Filling with mean/median/mode
  - Using `scikit-learn`’s `SimpleImputer`
- **Encoding Categorical Data**
  - Label Encoding
  - Ordinal Encoding
  - One-Hot Encoding
- **Working with Duplicates & Nulls**
  - Detecting and removing duplicate rows
  - Checking for null values and strategies to handle them
- **Other Preprocessing Techniques**
  - Basic feature transformations
  - Quick references for data cleaning functions

## 📝 Notes for Learners
- Each notebook is meant to be **self-contained**: you can open any one and follow along.  
- I’ve added **examples and explanations** for every method to make revision easy.  
- These notes are **practical-focused**, not theory-heavy, so you can see exactly how to apply each technique.  
- Feel free to **fork, adapt, or add your own examples** — the more we share, the easier it gets for beginners.

## 🎯 Purpose
These are **learning notes** — not polished research projects.  
I made them to practice, revise, and help others who are starting out in **Data Science / Machine Learning** and need quick reference material.

## 📢 Disclaimer
This repo is meant for **learning and practice**. Use these methods as references and adapt them to your own datasets.
